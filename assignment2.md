In an increasingly digital world, I appreciated the lessons of this course very much. While coding was not something that I had been taught in any of my previous years of university experience, I do think it is a vital part for communication. Communication is a large branch of Intercultural Studies (Fitzpatrick 2020) and scholars consistently advocate for people to step outside of what they know and try on different perspectives (Lyu 2024). This should apply in more than one direction. Therefore, I found the digital and coding experience very interesting. 

It diverges greatly from my usual course work, and while some of the approaches are different and more practical, I have also found some matters, that coding and Intercultural Studies have in common. In class we were encouraged to employ computational thinking skills (Smuts 2025). This is something that, albeit in a varied form, we often utilize in Intercultural Studies as well. This begins already when choosing a case to research. An intercultural researcher should constantly self-reflect, why are they choosing a specific project and why are they approaching it in that way, how is their positionality relevant to this research, … (Hsieh 2018). When a theoretical approach comes up short, researchers have to address the issue and break down the problem solving into smaller parts. Maybe they did not use the right analysis tool or they should choose a different methodology in their approach. It is extremely beneficial to be exchanging ideas with colleagues. This is something that has also aided my coding experience, when I was stuck with a specific issue. A new perspective enabled me to move forward with my coding.

While the final exam entails deploying a website to facilitate interdisciplinary understanding and give an insight into our disciplines to other students, I have also gained valuable insights into how other disciplines approach problem solving, specifically the STEM perspective. While it is only a small insight, having a course that has a much more practical approach (ie. building a website) than what Intercultural Studies majors usually experience in class, has been invaluable.

While coding and creating the website, some details were easier to figure out than others. One of the most challenging problems was changing the code and something did happen on the website but not in the way that I expected it or had planned it. The most poignant example was the attempt to display an API after clicking a button. While we had done this in class before, I struggled to replicate the code to deploy an API when clicking a specific button. Once I managed to solve this problem, I had to address the follow up issue of having additional content deployed under a button, that was not supposed to be there anymore.

It was fairly easy to imagine what I expected from my website, but to actually succeed in aligning my vision with the reality was much harder. However, perseverance and looking at aspects from a new angle aided me in the solution process, and each time an issue arose, the solution took a bit less time to find.

The most helpful tool, alongside the slides from class, was the MDN coding playground (Playground | MDN n.d.), where I could change the code and could see side by side what happened on the website, and whether it fixed the issue in a satisfactory way or not. This was not only great to achieve the design that I aimed for, but it also made it much clearer to me, what the function of each line of code is and what it leads to. Another great resource were the explanations on W3Schools.com, also a resource provided in class. The explanations and the opportunity to also change the code and see how it differed made many aspects and functions easier to understand.

I enjoyed experimenting with the color and the placement of images and text a lot. While I had very specific ideas, what I wanted my website to look like, I did continuously struggle with coding specific placement for images for example. In one case, I did manage to center the image but that led to the text being displayed unreadably. Seeing the effects made me understand better what each line of code represents and achieves. While it was often intuitive to understand where the problem might be, I continuously had to do a lot of reading to understand how to fix a specific issue. There were many attempts at different variations of code, to understand how to fix one single line or one image.

Significant was also the attempt to classify different contents, in order for their deployment to not look the same, and then subsequently how to figure out the content not being double-loaded onto a page.

It was not easy to focus on the larger picture, when every aspect of code is important. While there were larger frame references that were important to get right in order to deploy the website, other features were not to be overlooked. Whenever a piece of code was problematic or did not react in the way that I expected it to, it was also a reprieve to be able to look at another part of the website, that was easier to understand and, for lack of a better word, fun to adjust.
