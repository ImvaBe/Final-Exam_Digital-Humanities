In an increasingly digital world, the lessons of this course were appreciated. While coding was not something that had been taught in any of the previous courses of Intercultural Studies, it is a vital part of communication and therefore an important aspect for students to at least have a base level understanding of. Communication is a large branch of Intercultural Studies (Fitzpatrick 2020) and scholars consistently advocate for people to step outside of what they know and try on different perspectives (Lyu 2024). This includes Humanities students learning about STEM subjects, but also the other way around. This course provided the opportunity to give insight to different fields of studies on a base level.

The course diverged greatly from the usual course work, and while some of the approaches are different and more practical, there have also been some matters, that coding and Intercultural Studies have in common. In class, students were encouraged to employ computational thinking skills (Smuts 2025). This is something that, albeit in a varied form, students also often utilize in Intercultural Studies as well. This begins already when choosing a case to research. An intercultural researcher should constantly self-reflect, why are they choosing a specific project and why are they approaching it in that way, how is their positionality relevant to this research, … (Hsieh 2018). When a theoretical approach comes up short, researchers have to address the issue and break down the problem solving into smaller parts. Maybe they did not use the right analysis tool or they should choose a different methodology in their approach. It is extremely beneficial to be exchanging ideas with colleagues. This is something that has also aided my coding experience, when I was stuck with a specific issue. A new perspective enabled me to move forward with the coding.

While the final exam entails deploying a website to facilitate interdisciplinary understanding and give an insight into our disciplines to other students, valuable insights into how other disciplines approach problem solving have been gained, specifically the STEM perspective. While it is only a small insight, having a course that has a much more practical approach (ie. building a website) than what Intercultural Studies majors usually experience in class, which relates a lot to theorizing and discussions, has been valuable.

While coding and creating the website, some details were easier to figure out than others. One of the most challenging problems was changing the code and something did happen on the website but not in the way that was expected or planned. The most poignant example was the attempt to display an API after clicking a button. While this had been done and shown in class before, I struggled to replicate the code to deploy an API when clicking a specific button. Once the problem was solved, the follow up issue of having additional content deployed under a button, that was not supposed to be there anymore, had to be addressed. This further highlighted the interconnectedness of the code, which parts react to each other and lead to which outcome.

The final product was easy to imagine in a design sense, however to actually succeed in aligning the vision with reality was much harder. In the end, perseverance and looking at aspects from a new angle were great aids in the solution process, and each time an issue arose, the solution took a bit less time to figure out. 

<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Solutions</h2></div></div>

The most helpful tool, alongside the slides from class, was the MDN coding playground (Playground | MDN n.d.), where one can change the code and can see side by side what happens on the website, and whether it fixes the issue in a satisfactory way or not. This was not only great to achieve the design that was aimed at, but it also made it much clearer, what the function of each line of code is and what it leads to. Another great resource were the explanations on W3Schools.com, also a resource provided in class. The explanations and the opportunity to change the code on the website as well, and see how it differed, made many aspects and functions easier to understand. 

<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Experimenting</h2></div></div> 

Experimenting with different colors and the placement of images and text was quite enjoyable. While there were very specific ideas, what the final product was supposed to look like, there was also a continuous struggle with coding specific placements for images for example. In one case, I did manage to center the image but that led to the text being displayed in an unreadable manner. Seeing the effects was helpful to understand better what each line of code represents and achieves. While it was often intuitive to understand where the problem might be, it was a continuous effort, with a lot of reading to understand how to fix a specific issue. There were many attempts at different variations of code, to understand how to fix one single line or one image.

Significant was also the attempt to classify different contents, in order for their deployment to not look the same, and then subsequently how to figure out the content not being double-loaded onto a page.

It was not easy to focus on the larger picture, when every aspect of code is important. While there were frame references that were important to get right in order to deploy the website, other features were not to be overlooked. Whenever a piece of code was problematic or did not react in the way that it was expected to, it was also a reprieve to be able to look at another part of the website, that was easier to understand and, for lack of a better word, fun to adjust.
