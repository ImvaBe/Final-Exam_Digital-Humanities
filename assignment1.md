<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Introduction </h2></div></div>

Technological innovation has been a steady source of change since its invention. While some scientific and professional fields have more obvious areas that are affected or benefit from digital technologies, they can be relevant to any field one chooses to examine. Intercultural Studies is a field that looks at the interaction between cultures, as well as culture as a resource or a point of potential miscommunication and stereotypes. First and foremost are people the subject of studies, but that does not mean that digital technologies do not have an enormous influence. Like any social science, Intercultural Studies benefits from technological advancement, because it makes computing large sets of data easier and can be an asset in field work for example. There are certain aspects, however, that cannot be replaced by digital technologies, like participant observation or having conversations with the subjects of your study. 

No field of study should close themselves off to technological advancement, but the implementation of new technologies should be viewed critically and be continuously assessed for their impact on a field and on processes. This text will give a brief overview of the current digital technologies that are commonly used in the field of Intercultural Studies. Then it will look at the benefits and pitfalls of Artificial Intelligence being introduced further than it already has been. In the end, it will be considered how important technology is to the field, and which technologies one should be able to operate within Intercultural Studies.
	
<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Current digital technologies used in Intercultural Studies</h2></div></div>

Intercultural Studies is part of the field of social sciences, which historically has used digital technologies as a means of communication and data storage, but not necessarily as a primary aspect of the field. Naturally, the field cannot be separated and thought about without technology anymore, as they have become a part of our everyday lives and always must be considered. 
Digital technologies that are currently being used in the field of Intercultural Studies are services that help process quantitative data for large studies. Furthermore, programs that facilitate communication over long distances make it possible for scientists to reach out and request information from people all over the world, without necessarily having to travel there (although it is highly recommended to travel any place one intends to write about, unless it is the specific intent to study fx. a company culture purely through internet communication). Digital communication tools are supposed to help ease intercultural communication and foster intercultural understanding. 
The internet itself provides rich grounds for all kinds of studies within the field of interculturality. One can easily use social media and virtual spaces as subjects to be studied. Although not everyone has access to the internet or a smartphone (Digital Around the World — DataReportal – Global Digital Insights, n.d.), they can be tools that foster intercultural understanding, as information about other cultures is more easily accessible. However, this also contains the downside of misinformation being spread more easily, and because of algorithms, there is a very real possibility of landing in an echo chamber on social media. These are phenomena that are also interesting for intercultural scientists. 
Promising study areas can involve looking at the way that social media changes communication between Gen Zers themselves, between people from different generations, and the spread of national phenomena to an international interest (fx. movies from Hollywood, memes, KPOP, …). 
Another important aspect is emerging technologies, where it cannot yet be comprehended, how much of an impact they will have not only on daily life, but also on fields of studies. A range of tools facilitate intercultural communication and are therefore interesting to study. For example, rising technologies like virtual reality devices or artificial intelligence almost certainly will have broad and long-lasting impacts on this (or for that matter any) field. This impact needs to be closely studied, as it is such a volatile field. 

<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Technologies that could potentially disrupt the status quo</h2></div></div>

One technology that has recently been more widely introduced is artificial intelligence. Although in some ways it has been around in less noticeable ways before, like automated search engine suggestions or systems trained to recognize patterns and learn from data, like a chess computer. Artificial intelligence has been a topic long before the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 (Walsh, 2025). 

The difference now is the implementation of the large language models (LLMs), that are trained to give answers that are put together based on large amounts of data. Though relatively new, using AI is already allowed to be used by students at Aarhus University to aid in their exams since last year (2024). They are required to disclose in which way they have applied AI in their exams and hand-ins, and to mark their own work clearly (Aarhus University n.d.). 

In my opinion, there are already disruptions in the way things used to be done in Intercultural Studies. It is not singular to this field, therefore it has a wider impact. Some negative impacts are the decline of soft skills and the reliance on information without checking the sources. There is a big difference between reading an academic text and forming one's own questions about it or asking a LLM to summarize it for the reader. While it can be difficult at the beginning of an academic career to get used to the way academic texts are written, that is part of one’s education, and students get used to it, as well as picking up on how an argument is built in a paper. Furthermore, reading papers in social sciences is also supposed to develop further critical thinking in students (Mehta et al. 2015). When students do not read a paper themselves, they are also taking away the option to form questions that might arise while reading.
While AI already is and has been a part of many websites and everyone often uses it unconsciously, I think the usage of LLMs like ChatGPT has a mostly negative impact, specifically on students, in the field of Intercultural Studies. If one has already been trained and completed one’s education, then AI can be a tool that can be used in research. But if students are only starting out and are using AI as a tool in exams, certain soft skills are not learned as easily, which can have an effect later on. 

Of course, AI will not simply cease to exist now, therefore it is relevant to actively think about how it can be utilized best. It will not be helpful to demonize it, however it is important to be clear about the potential negative impacts, like reduction of soft skills, possible wrong information, the creation of a vicious cycle if a LLM starts training itself on its own data, thereby multiplying incorrect output, or considering the environmental impact it has (Aljuaid 2024; Fosner 2024). 

AI does have its place, for example by being trained in reading medical data and potentially aiding doctors in diagnoses (Al-antari 2024). In Intercultural Studies it could potentially be used to overcome language barriers, to foster intercultural understanding, and to collaborate internationally, albeit all of these have been practiced for decades without artificial intelligence. 

<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Are there vital technologies in Intercultural Studies?</h2></div></div>

While I do not think that technologies are inherently vital to the field of Intercultural Studies, the field is not immune to technological change. One could do an intercultural study with a notebook and a pen, for example when doing field research and practicing participant observation. However, since the core subjects of this field are humans, culture, and the interaction/intersection of differing cultures, one always must consider digital technologies and their effects on the aforementioned. 

Naturally, students can go to the library to borrow books on their subjects, but finding relevant research and reading has been made much easier by using computers. When processing large amounts of data, it is also more convenient to use technology to organize these sets of data and notes. If artificial intelligence is used as a tool and not as a replacement it can be useful. 

Future students will have to be trained properly in using AI as a tool, because it possibly will change every field of study. It is not useful to bar oneself against it, but instead learn how to use it. In relation to that, it is also relevant to learn how to spot AI content in other people’s work. A positive aspect can be to teach students a critical awareness of sources and misinformation campaigns online.

<div class="container"><div class="fancy"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div></div>

In summary, no field will remain untouched by artificial intelligence. Universities in general, and Intercultural Studies specifically, are currently still in the starting phase of finding out what implementing large language models means for many different areas of studies, including interculturality. I would argue the most relevant aspect is to study the impact of LLMs on communication, on research, on students, on information processing, and on the rise or fall of so-called fake news. 

To study the effect of something, one must be well versed in it. This requires Intercultural scientists to be aware of the inner workings, pitfalls, and upsides of models like ChatGPT. AI will not go away; therefore, a way must be found to deal with it responsibly and furthermore develop studies and teachings about how to do that. It is important to design studies about, for example, the effect of AI on soft skills of students, but also on their confidence in their own skills. 

Overall, I do think the most interesting aspect that AI can contribute as a digital technology to the field of Intercultural Studies is the opportunities for studies that it provides. This could include looking at AI’s impact on teaching and learning in schools and universities, or the change in communication between international organizations. The further-reaching impacts remain to be seen.
