#README

This project is an introduction to Digital Technologies in the Humanities, with the focus on Intercultural Studies. The website deployed from this GitHub project includes a written assignment that deals with AI in Intercultural Studies.

Furthermore, the process of designing the website is explained, including mentioning some of the more challenging aspects of coding this specific website.

The project gives insight to an aspect of Intercultural Studies and, looking at the code, gives an overview of base level coding, as well as potential ideas how to style one’s own website. 

If there are questions, leave an issue comment, and I will get back to them as soon as possible.

This project is now concluded, so there will be no further updates to it. It will stay up as it is on the GitHub website.
